1GAM-Jan-Snowboard
==================

Snowboarding game using the Sifteo platform!

To play it you will need Sifteos hardware or the sdk avalible from [here.](https://developers.sifteo.com/download "SDK Download link")

This was my January release for (http://onegameamonth.com) as well as my entry for (http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/). In total the project took about 20-25 hours. I did all of the art and code(I'm no artist sorry), but the music is public domain from the [Mod archive.](http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=172898 "link to sound file")
