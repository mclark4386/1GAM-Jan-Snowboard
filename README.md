1GAM-Jan-Snowboard
==================

Snowboarding game using the Sifteo platform!

To play it you will need Sifteos hardware or the sdk avalible from [here.](https://developers.sifteo.com/download "SDK Download link")

This was my January release for (http://onegameamonth.com) as well as my entry for (http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/). In total the project took about 20-25 hours. I did all of the art and code(I'm no artist sorry), but the music is public domain from the [Mod archive.](http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=172898 "link to sound file")

TO PLAY on SDK:
You can either run 
    **siftulator /path/to/snowboard.elf**
or from the root directory of this repo run 
    **make run**  .
Once you have the game running on the emulator you can right click to tilt the cube you want to change the mountain on to get the player down and through the finish line, but watchout for the edge and obstacles in the way!
